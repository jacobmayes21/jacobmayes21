Hello there, I'm Jacob Mayes and I am a student currently attending Idaho State University looking for opportunities to learn new skills and gain experiences in as many fields as I am able. 

I am a Creative Writing Major (also taking a minor in Public Relations/Advertising) and will be graduating the Spring Semester of 2024. 

What interests me most about the Creative Writing Major is that it will provide many opportunities to develop my writing skills, give me an excuse to read classic and contemporary literature and analyze them, and increase my chances of applying my writing as a skill in my career. 

My main interests are playing tabletop roleplaying games, board games, video games, reading books and manga, and watching anime/any animated show. I'm also a sucker for any sort of art museum and art galleries that I can explore if given the chance. However, I do have one passion above all others that I cannot help but obsess over. 

My passion above all others is cooking. I am a novice compared to many, but the preparation, execution, and consumption of a meal is an extremely gratifying and human experience. I love cooking. It is a part of my identity that is nigh impossible to separate from myself. Caring for and maintaining a functional kitchen is an important part of my home life and will likely be until I pass away. 

My favorite painter is Denis Lebeque, specificallly his  _Dreamy Grey_ series and, from his _Shiny Reds_ series, a piece entitled: _RETOUR DE PÃŠCHE_.

My favorite favorite Mangakas are Tatsuki Fujimoto and Kentaro Mirua.

My favorite chefs are David Chang, J. Kenji Lopez Alt, & Grant Achatz.

My favorite books are _Dune: Messaiah_ and _Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_. 

My favorite movies are _Inglorious Basterds_, _A Serious Man_, and _Knives Out_. 

My favorite video games are _Disco Elysium_, _Darkest Dungeon_, _Hades_, and _Oxenfree_.
