Hello there, I'm Jacob Mayes and I am a student currently attending Idaho State University looking for opportunities to learn new skills and gain experiences in as many fields as I am able. 

I am a Creative Writing Major and will be graduating the Spring Semester of 2024. 

What interests me most about the Creative Writing Major is that it will provide many opportunities to develop my writing skills, give me an excuse to read classic and contemporary literature and analyze them, and increase my chances of applying my writing as a skill in my career. 

My main interests are playing tabletop roleplaying games, board games, video games (quite the variety of games), reading books and manga, and watching anime/any animated show. I'm also a sucker for any sort of art museum and art galleries that I can explore if given the chance. However, I do have one passion above all others that I cannot help but obsess over. 

My passion above all others is cooking. I am a novice compared to many, but the preparation, execution, and consumption of a meal is one of the most satisfying acts of human connection and compassion one can experience. I love cooking. It is a part of my identity that is nigh impossible to separate from myself. I have consumed tens of thousands of hours of cooking content from the Food Network to obscure food scientists on Youtube to learn from the best and to this date I feel as though I have barely scratched the surface of the culinary iceberg. I look forward to cooking more. 

My favorite painter is Denis Lebeque, specificallly his  _Dreamy Grey_ series and, from his _Shiny Reds_ series, a piece entitled: _RETOUR DE PÃŠCHE_.

My favorite favorite Mangakas are Tatsuki Fujimoto and Kentaro Mirua.

My favorite chefs & cooks are Chef Isaac Toupes, Chef David Chang, J. Kenji Lopez Alt, & Chef Grant Achatz.
