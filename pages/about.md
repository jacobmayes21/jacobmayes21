Hello there, I'm Jacob Mayes and I am a student currently attending Idaho State University looking for opportunities to learn new skills and gain experiences in as many fields as I am able. 

I am a Creative Writing Major and will be graduating the Spring Semester of 2024. 

What interests me most about the Creative Writing Major is that it will provide many opportunities to develop my writing skills, give me an excuse to read classic and contemporary literature and analyze them, and increase my chances of applying my writing as a skill in my career. 

My main interests are playing tabletop roleplaying games, board games, video games (quite the variety of games), reading books and manga, and watching anime/any animated show. I'm also a sucker for any sort of art museum and art galleries that I can explore if given the chance. 


My favorite painter is Denis Lebeque, specificallly his  _Dreamy Grey_ series and, from his _Shiny Reds_ series, a piece entitled: _RETOUR DE PÃŠCHE_
My favorite favorite Mangakas are Tatsuki Fujimoto and Kentaro Mirua
